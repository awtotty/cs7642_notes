## Generalization 

### Recap
- Large state space requires generalization
- Use supervised learning to generalize
    - Linear function approximation
    - ANNs
- Successes 
    - TD-Gammon
    - DQN
- Averagers
    - Converges to optimal value function with function approximation
    - Function approximator can be viewed as a MDP 
    - Analogous to KNN
