## Game Theory 2 

### Recap
- Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma is an example of a repeated game
    - We can encourage cooperation in repeated games 
    - New NE appear in repeated games
    - Folk Theorem (threats)
    - Equilibria can be subgame perfect 
    - If a game is not subgame perfect, threats can be implausible 
    - Computational folk theorem
- Stochastic games generalize MDPs and repeated games
    - Minimax-Q works
    - Nash-Q doesn't work
