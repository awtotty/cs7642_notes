## Game Theory 3 

### Recap
- Solution concepts: 
    - Correlated equilibria
        - Shared source of randomization
        - Traffic light example
    - Coco values
        - Binding side payments
        - Encourages Pareto optimal actions
    - Nash
    - Subgame perfect
- Mechanism design: designing games or extensions of games to produce desired behavior
    - Peer teaching (J. Pollack's work)
    - King Solomon
- All of these cases (except NE) show extensions of games to yield desired behavior
