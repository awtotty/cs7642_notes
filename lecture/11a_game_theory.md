## Game Theory 1 

### Two-Player, Zero-Sum, Deterministic Games with Perfect Information
- Minimax = maximin in this type of game
- There is **always** an optimal pure strategy for each player
- Assume agents are rational (trying to maximize their own reward and each assumes all other agents are doing the same)
- Non-deterministic games can be reduced to deterministic games by finding expected return given the model of the game

### Games with Hidden Information
- Mixed strategies are necessary when there is hidden information (e.g. RPS)
- Now optimal pure strategies are not guaranteed

### General-Sum Games
- Prisoner's dilemma
- Nash equilibria: no player would change their strategy given they known everyone else's strategy
    - Any NE survives elimination of strictly dominated strategies
    - If there are a finite number of players and the game is finite, there exists a (possibly mixed) Nash

### Recap
- Prisoner's dilemma
- Repeated games unravel when you know when they will end
- Minimax 
- Hidden/perfect information
- Pure/mixed strategies
- Deterministic/stochastic games
- Nash equilibria
